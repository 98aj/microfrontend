    <h1>Hello This is webpack info to create bundel of application.</h1>
    <h2>Steps To Start (basics)</h2>
    <p>
      1. In package.json create a build script of webpack and run command npm
      run build. it will create main.js in dist
    </p>
    <p>2. Add this file in script tag of html file</p>
    <p>3. Create a js file in src and add some function to it</p>
    <p>4. Import it to index and call function</p>
    <p>
      5. Now delete build and type command npm run build. it will create
      minified version of all files in main.js
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Now run the app on browser and check console. You have created webpack
      bundle appliction which is minified version of application.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps to create webpack config</h2>
    <p>1. Create Webpack config in root folder</p>
    <p>2. Add configs to module.export.</p>
    <p>
      3. Set 'mode' option to 'development' or 'production' to enable defaults
      for each environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Not delete main.js and create another build. now you will see the
      changes in file of main.js.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps to create entry and output for webpack</h2>
    <p>1. Delete old build file from dist main.js</p>
    <p>2. For Understanding remain index file to App.js</p>
    <p>3. In webpack.config.js create to key entry and output keys.</p>
    <p>
      4. Entry point : provide app.js path in entry key. now this file will be
      your entry point for app
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Output point :<br />
      1. Import path package from node to get path of your files.<br />
      2. Create object for output and provide path where we want to create
      minified buldel of application and provide file name for it.<br />3. Now
      replace this file details in script file with main.js
    </p>
    <strong>Now to run minified app you need to delete the old build and again create new build which is very tideous task so now we will automeate the process.</strong>

    <h2>Steps to create minified version on every changes done in application. Automating build</h2>
    <p>1. Install webpack-dev-server</p>
    <p>2. Create start script in package json "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open"</p>
    <p>3. In webpack config add devServer key and asign bject which contain the folder name using path.join and add port number</p>
    <p>4. use command npm start. your dev server will be stared with webpack try to change function it will use hrm to reload changes.</p>
